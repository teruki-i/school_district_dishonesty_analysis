# Analysis of Academic Dishonesty's Impact on School District

## Overview

In this analysis, I used student and school data from a school district to summarize math and reading scores based on factors such as school budget and size. Furthermore, due to allegations of academic dishonesty among ninth graders at one of the schools in the district (Thomas High School), the analysis was run twice, both with and without ninth graders from Thomas High School (THS). I compared the results of both analyses to determine whether or not the academic dishonesty had any impact.

## Results

The results are were as below as below:

- District-wide scores barely changed between the two analyses.
    - The average math score decreased by only 0.01% after removing THS ninth graders.
    - The average reading score didn't change at all.
    - The percentage of students passing math decreased by only 0.2%.
    - The percentage of students passing reading decreased by only 0.1%.
    - The percentage of students passing both decreased by only 0.3%.

- More specifically, the overall scores at THS barely changed between the two analyses.
    - The average math score decreased from approximately 83.42 to 83.35 after removing ninth graders.
    - The average reading score increased from approximately 83.84 to 83.90 after removing ninth graders.
    - The percentage of students passing math decreased from approximately 93.27% to 93.19% after removing ninth graders.
    - The percentage of students passing reading decreased from approximately 97.31% to 97.02% after removing ninth graders.
    - The percentage of students passing both decreased from approximately 90.95% to 90.63%.

- THS's perforamnce relative to other schools in the district also didn't change as THS's overall passing percentage was the second highest in the district both with and without ninth graders included.


- When comparing the scores at each school by grade level, the only difference is that there was no average score calculated for the THS ninth graders once they were removed from the data. If included, the THS ninth graders on average scored 83.6 on math and 83. 7 on reading.


- The results for both analyses are essentially identitical when comparing scores by school spending. Both with and without THS ninth graders, the results were:   

    - Schools spending less than $584/student
        - Average math score: 83.5
        - Average reading score: 83.9
        - Percent passing math: 93%
        - Percent passing reading: 97%
        - Percent passing both: 90%
    - Schools spending $585-$629/student
        - Average math score: 81.9
        - Average reading score: 83.2
        - Percent passing math: 87%
        - Percent passing reading: 93%
        - Percent passing both: 81%
    - Schools spending $630-644/student
        - Average math score: 78.5
        - Average reading score: 81.6
        - Percent passing math: 73%
        - Percent passing reading: 84%
        - Percent passing both: 63%
    - Schools spending $644-$675/student
        - Average math score: 77.0
        - Average reading score: 81.0
        - Percent passing math: 66%
        - Percent passing reading: 81%
        - Percent passing both: 54%

- The scores by school size were also identical in both analyses. Both with and without THS ninth graders, the results were:

    - Small schools
        - Average math score: 83.8
        - Average reading score: 83.9
        - Percent passing math: 94%
        - Percent passing reading: 96%
        - Percent passing both: 90%
    - Medium schools
        - Average math score: 83.4
        - Average reading score: 83.9
        - Percent passing math: 94%
        - Percent passing reading: 97%
        - Percent passing both: 91%
    - Large schools
        - Average math score: 77.7
        - Average reading score: 81.3
        - Percent passing math: 70%
        - Percent passing reading: 83%
        - Percent passing both: 58%


- The scores by school type were also identical in both analyses. Both with and without THS ninth graders, the results were:
    - Charter schools
        - Average math score: 83.5
        - Average reading score: 83.9
        - Percent passing math: 94%
        - Percent passing reading: 97%
        - Percent passing both: 90%
    - District schools
        - Average math score: 77.0
        - Average reading score: 81.0
        - Percent passing math: 67%
        - Percent passing reading: 81%
        - Percent passing both: 54%

## Summary
Overall, test scores saw almost no changes when dropping THS ninth graders from the analysis. Once the THS ninth graders' scores are dropped, the changes can be best captured by looking at the changes in THS scores:

- An approximately 0.07 decrease in THS's average math score
- An approximately 0.06 increase in THS's average reading score
- An approximately 0.08% in the percentage of THS students passing math
- An approximately 0.29% in the percentage of THS students passing reading

However, it is impossible to tell whether or not the alleged academic dishonesty among THS ninth graders had any impact on the results. The fact that the results in both analyses were nearly identical suggests that THS ninth graders' test scores in the data were overall similar to the scores of the rest of the school. And because the scale of the alleged grade manipulation was unknown, it's impossible to tell how similar the ninth graders' scores should really be to the rest of the scores at THS. Additional data and further analyses will be necessary to shed light on this issue.
